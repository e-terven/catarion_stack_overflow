There is _@DataSet_ annotation is implemented to configure a DataSet (vs. DBUnit) and is specified with the following feature:  

- _strategy = SeedStrategy.INSERT_  meaning that DBUnit will insert data in tables present on provided data;  

- _skipCleaningFor_  allows to skip cleaning for  _"db_liquibase"_ to preserve data that is managed by an external tool - Liquibase;  

- _cleanAfter_  calls a cleaning process after test that will ensure any changes are rolled back to leave the database in its original state;  

- _tableOrder_  defines the order in which tables should be cleaned after the test to ensure child tables will be cleaned before their parents.
