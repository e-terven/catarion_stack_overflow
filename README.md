## Tasks I complited

#### ‚úÖ Built All Questions page with **HTML** and **Bootstrap**
------

![alt-—Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç](https://github.com/e-terven/catarion_stack_overflow/blob/5af8114d05fae37628bd7af0391f60a15caf9218/images/catarion_stack_overflow/AllQuestions.png)

#### ‚úÖ Implemented API in ResourceAnswerController:
    POST api/user/question/{questionId}/answer/{id}/downVote.
    When User votes for an Answer, Reputation of the Answer's author looses 5 points.
    The API returns a Total Vote Count (sum of up- and downvotes) and should be documented. Only for authorized users. 

------
Ok. I took answer and question id from url and an authorized user frrom SecurityContext container:

The interesting thing here is that there are conditions we have to consider before counting and post a total amount of votes. Such as:
1. User can vote down only once.
   Thus, the method _voteAnswerExists_ in ResourceAnswerController validates if the object already exists in database:

   further, in VoteAnswerService:

   finally, in a VoteAnswerDao:
![alt-—Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç](https://github.com/e-terven/catarion_stack_overflow/blob/6011183f856fc58e4060dde2918b85a06ad6702e/images/catarion_stack_overflow/VoteAnswer-3.png)

2. User cannot vote for own answer. Therefore, I checked if the User is not an author of the Answer in REST-Controller by implementing the _getByIdAndChecked_ method that queries the information from database:

   Service layer:

   Dao layer:
![alt-—Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç](https://github.com/e-terven/catarion_stack_overflow/blob/6dedd3602cbe77cc9224bb737029be5abfae8d43/images/catarion_stack_overflow/Answer-3.png)


4. The author of the Answer has to be "granted" by -5 points; ergo, his Reputation status should be updated
5. To return the Total amount of votes we have to compute both down and up votes of the Answer.

Besides, we have to check if the answer and the question (related to the answer) exist. Here I use EnitityManager in Dao layer to query information from database.

Let us focus on the _**reputationService.updateCountByDown**_ that takes two parameters: a User who wrote the Answer and an Answer's ID:

_@DataSet_ annotation is implemented to configure a DataSet (vs. DBUnit) and is specified with the following feature:  

- _strategy = SeedStrategy.INSERT_  meaning that DBUnit will insert data in tables present on provided data;  

- _skipCleaningFor_  allows to skip cleaning for  _"db_liquibase"_ to preserve data that is managed by an external tool - Liquibase;  

- _cleanAfter_  calls a cleaning process after test that will ensure any changes are rolled back to leave the database in its original state;  

- _tableOrder_  defines the order in which tables should be cleaned after the test to ensure child tables will be cleaned before their parents.
